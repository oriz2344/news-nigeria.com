<p class="bankyw">Singer and politician Olubankole Wellington aka Banky W has partnered with his church to give over 2,500 items as well as free medical services in a bid to give back to the society.<br/>Banky, who contested for the Eti-Osa Federal Constituency seat for House of Representatives under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but lost to Labour Party’s Thaddeus Attah, explained community service shouldn’t be dependent only on whether politicians won during elections.He said if that were the case, then such a politician didn’t deserve the chance to rule the people.<br/>He appreciated volunteers who came out in their numbers to ensure the event was a success,“If our service to the community was only dependent on whether we got a seat in government or not, then we don’t deserve a seat in the first place.“Good Friday was a great Friday.<br/> #thebworg x #mywaterbrook partnered together and we pulled off an amazing, free clothing and medical drive.“Over 2,500 items given away, and hundreds of people given free access to medical services. Thank you to everyone who donated their time, talent, treasure and resources to make this a success.“Thank you to the most amazing volunteers on earth. Thank you to the companies that teamed up with us, including Medpau, Medbury, Kazodo Health, Mai Atafo, Trax Apparel, Ugo Monye, Clean Ace Dry Cleaning, and so many more,” he said.
